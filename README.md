# VirtualVerseTask

This repository contains my implementation for the **Virtual Verse Studio internship task** using Unity 3D. It includes a complete Unity project demonstrating the required 3D configuration and functionality as specified in the assessment brief.

## 📌 Overview

This project is a solution to the Virtual Verse Studio Unity assessment. The goal of this task is to create a Unity scene with interactive 3D elements and demonstrate understanding of Unity fundamentals, including scripting, scene setup, and configuration workflows.

Alongside the project files, the repository includes the original assessment document:  
**`Unity Developer Assessment 3D Configuration Module.pdf`** detailing the requirements and expected deliverables.

## 🛠 Features

- Unity 3D project setup with configurations matching the assessment criteria.
- Scripts written in C# to implement core gameplay or interaction mechanics.
- Organized assets, scenes, and project settings for clarity and maintainability.
- Demonstrates fundamental Unity features: GameObjects, components, scripting, and scene interactions.
